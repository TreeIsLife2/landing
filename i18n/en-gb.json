	"about-desc": "In July 2015, John Lewis and Ferran Tufan created a new wiki farm - named Miraheze. Through the use of community crowdfunding and personal investment, Miraheze officially went live in August of 2015. Over the years, the project has grown immensely to be one of the largest and most recognisable wiki farms specialising in MediaWiki on offer. Despite the success and evolution, one aspect of Miraheze never changed - formal existence. In November 2019, Miraheze became a registered not-for-profit in the UK as Miraheze Limited. In Janurary 2024 operations were transfered to WikiTide Foundation."
